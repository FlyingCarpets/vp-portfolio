List:

title
image
short description
long description
link
radio or select for portrait/landscape image (possible from graphql)

idea:
- add above to audio/trainings/stories
- add related field https://docs.stackbit.com/best-practices/relationships-netlify-cms/
- in homepage
    - add two fields: portrait image and landscape image
    - add related field searches in those fields
    - search for wanted items according to their image aspect ratio (e.g. in small image search field - a list with only small images appear)
