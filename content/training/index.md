I have conducted science and environmental communication training workshops for youth, researchers and environmental protection professionals. My clients include State Service for Protected Areas, the European Commission representation in Lithuania and the British Council Lithuania.

I am reading a course in radio documentary production at the [Lithuanian Journalism Center](https://lzc.lt/komanda/).

Since 2020 I am a mentor of the Ake Blomstrom international [training program](https://ifc2.wordpress.com/ake-blomstrom-home/) for audio producers.
