I am award-winning radio producer and experienced audio storyteller with special focus on how humans are trying to save this beautiful planet while destroying it simultaneously.

I work for the Lithuanian national broadcaster, LRT, where I produce and co-host a weekly radio programme on environment and radio documentaries – layered, in depth crafted non-fiction stories where a combination of voice and soundscapes helps create a special space for human mind and soul to wonder, feel, understand and discover.
