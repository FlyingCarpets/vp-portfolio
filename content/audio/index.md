I am experienced audio storyteller specialized in history, culture, science and environment.\
\
Since 2004, I have been covering these thematic areas as a producer of a weekly radio programme ([‘Vienkartinė planeta‘](https://www.lrt.lt/mediateka/audio/radijo-laidos/vienkartine-planeta)) on environment for the national radio, LRT RADIO, which I am co-hosting now. \
\
Most recently I have been focusing on radio features (or documentaries) – more complex, layered, in depth crafted non-fiction stories where a combination of voice and soundscapes helps create a special space for human mind and soul to wonder, feel, understand and discover.\ 
\
I have produced 30+ original radio features on history, culture, science and nature since 2006. I research, plan, conduct interviews, script, edit, mix and create sound design by myself. \
\
My work has won numerous national and international awards and was nominated at the prestigious [PRIX EUROPA](https://www.prixeuropa.eu/) festival in Berlin in 2018.
